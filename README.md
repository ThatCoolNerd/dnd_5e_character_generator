Now that most of the initial code has been cleaned up and organized, gear generation and descriptions are planned, but there is no set time. Again, this is just a project for when I'm bored and feel like learning new things :D

In the future I might fix/add a system for adding descriptions based on wealth and clothing/armor/gear worn.

It should be noted that this was my foray into python programming and was my quarantine project for a week or so in the summer of last year. It's probably very sloppy. I'm just looking for constructive feedback, be it negative or positive.
