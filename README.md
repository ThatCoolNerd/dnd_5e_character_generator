# dnd_5e_character_generator
A tool for generating 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons characters

In the future I might fix/add a system for adding descriptions based on wealth and clothing/armor/gear worn.

It should be noted that this was my foray into python programming and was my quarantine project for a week or so in the summer of last year. It's probably very sloppy. I'm just looking for constructive feedback, be it negative or positive.
