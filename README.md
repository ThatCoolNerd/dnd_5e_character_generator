# dnd_5e_character_generator
A tool for generating 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons characters

Gear generation has been added. For ease of legibility, screen clearing has been added. Basic boundary-testing has been added. The enum CL_GEAR_STER in dnd_world.py will probably be moved to using configs in the future.

I haven't yet incorporated the addition of shields. The underlying code is in dnd_world.py, but hasn't yet been added. All other gear generation is working fine, but could probably be improved in some way.

Now that most of the initial code has been cleaned up and organized, gear generation and descriptions are planned, but there is no set time. Again, this is just a project for when I'm bored and feel like learning new things :D

In the future I might fix/add a system for adding descriptions based on wealth and clothing/armor/gear worn.

It should be noted that this was my foray into python programming and was my quarantine project for a week or so in the summer of last year. It's probably very sloppy. I'm just looking for constructive feedback, be it negative or positive.
